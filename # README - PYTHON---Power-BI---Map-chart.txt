create a map graph in PYTHON for power bi

To create a map graph in Python for Power BI, you can use the plotly library, which provides easy-to-use functions for creating interactive plots, including maps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Install Plotly: If you haven't already installed plotly, you can do so using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install plotly
Prepare your data: You need data with geographical information to plot on the map. Ensure your data includes latitude and longitude coordinates or country/city names that Plotly can recognize.

Create the Python script: Write a Python script that generates the map graph using plotly. Here's a simple example to get you started:

python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'City': ['Budapest', 'Debrecen', 'Szeged'],
    'Lat': [47.4979, 47.5316, 46.2530],
    'Lon': [19.0402, 21.6273, 20.1414],
    'Value': [100, 80, 60]  # Sample values for each city
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create map figure
fig = go.Figure(go.Scattermapbox(
    mode='markers+text',
    lat=df['Lat'],
    lon=df['Lon'],
    marker=go.scattermapbox.Marker(size=df['Value']),
    text=df['City'],
))

# Update layout
fig.update_layout(
    mapbox=dict(
        style='open-street-map',
        zoom=4,
        center=dict(lat=47.5, lon=19)
    ),
    margin=dict(r=0, l=0, t=0, b=0),
)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
Integrate with Power BI: After creating the map graph, save it as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG). Then, in Power BI, import the image into your report and position it where you want it to appear.

Configure interactions: If you want the map graph to interact with other visualizations in your Power BI report, you can set up interactions using Power BI's built-in features.

This example provides a starting point. You can customize the map's appearance, add tooltips, and incorporate additional features based on your specific requirements and data.
